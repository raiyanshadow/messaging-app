# Messaging-app
### CSC207 Final Project

- Summary of Application: This application is a messaging system that allows users to communicate with each other in real-time.
- User Stories:
  - User story 1 (Raiyan): As a user, I want to send and receive messages from other users so that we can have real time conversations with others. 
  - User story 2 (James): As a user, I want to create a new account if I don’t have one already so that my chats and messages are saved under this account. 
  - User story 3 (Angela): As a user, I want to be able to add other users as contacts so that I can message them directly. 
  - User story 4 (James): As a user, I want to be able to search for existing users so that I can add them as a contact. 
  - User story 5 (Salem): As a user, I want to be able to create a chat with another user or users so that I can message them. 
  - User story 6 (Sylvia): As a user, I want to be able to click into a chat so that I can view old messages and send new messages in that chat. 
  - User story 7 (Sophia): As a user, I want to log in with my credentials and log out of the app so that I can access my chats on my previously created account. 
  - User story 8 (Sophia): As a user, I want to be able to edit my profile information so that I can change my password, username, and language settings.
